It identifies the percentage of manufacturing time that is truly productive. An OEE of 100% means that only good parts are produced (100% quality), at the maximum speed (100% performance), and without interruption (100% availability).\n","\n","\n","### Calculations for OEE\n","The OEE of a manufacturing unit are calculated as the product of three separate components:\n","\n","* **Availability**: percentage of scheduled time that the operation is available to operate. Often referred to as Uptime.\n","\n","* **Quality**: Good Units produced as a percentage of the Total Units Started.\n","\n","* **Performance**: speed at which the Work Center runs as a percentage of its designed speed.\n","\n","\n","To learn more about calculating OEE, see the article on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overall_equipment_effectiveness).\n","\n","## Aim of the project\n","Build a Python function to calculate the OEE based on a given dataset.\n","\n","\n","## Dataset\n","Complete information about the dataset is available on the [dataset repository](https://github.com/i40a/datasets/blob/main/oee_simulation/info.md).\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"IluvOFK0Hmpa"},"id":"IluvOFK0Hmpa"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Load the dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"MupNg9x7TTCl"},"id":"MupNg9x7TTCl"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Load the csv file on the path below"],"metadata":{"id":"QNdOUtbaThx3"},"id":"QNdOUtbaThx3"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["path = 'https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/i40a/datasets/main/oee_simulation/original/oee.csv'"],"metadata":{"id":"2pIH5QmGnZyT"},"id":"2pIH5QmGnZyT","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# load csv file\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MzWCW5wpyEQD"},"id":"MzWCW5wpyEQD","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Preprocessing\n","\n","In order to save the entire dataset in a single CSV file, three different measurements are concateneted in a single table. \n","\n","\n","To better analyse and work with the dataset, we are going to start the project by spliting the dataset into two DataFrames:\n","\n","* df_state - DataFrame with the state of the plant.
