These control loops are installed and tuned based on the current state of the process. \n","\n","The performance of the control deteriorates over the lifetime of a plant because equipment ages and process dynamics change. So it is essential to detect and fix problems related to control loop performance.\n","\n","Monitoring the loops by visual inspection would consume high personal resources and limit the investigation to part of these loops. Aiming to verify automatically whether the controllers, actuators, and sensors are working correctly, control loop performance monitoring (CPM) plays a vital role in plant performance. CPM techniques included: controller performance assessment, non-linearity detection, oscillation detection, stiction detection, sensor fault detection, and others.\n","\n","To learn more about CPM, see the article on [this link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896316306036)\n","\n","\n","## Aim of the project\n","Build simple control loop performance indicator using Python
