These control loops are installed and tuned based on the current state of the process. \n","\n","The performance of the control deteriorates over the lifetime of a plant because equipment ages and process dynamics change. So it is essential to detect and fix problems related to control loop performance.\n","\n","Monitoring the loops by visual inspection would consume high personal resources and limit the investigation to part of these loops. Aiming to verify automatically whether the controllers, actuators, and sensors are working correctly, control loop performance monitoring (CPM) plays a vital role in plant performance. CPM techniques included: controller performance assessment, non-linearity detection, oscillation detection, stiction detection, sensor fault detection, and others.\n","\n","To learn more about CPM, see the article on [this link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896316306036)\n","\n","\n","## Aim of the project\n","Build simple control loop performance indicator using Python functions.\n","\n","## Dataset\n","Complete information about the dataset on the [dataset repository](https://github.com/i40a/datasets/blob/main/control_loop/info.md)."],"metadata":{"id":"IluvOFK0Hmpa"},"id":"IluvOFK0Hmpa"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Load the dataset"],"metadata":{"id":"n61I5rjrlPKN"},"id":"n61I5rjrlPKN"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Load the csv file on the path below (may take time, since it is a larger file)"],"metadata":{"id":"QNdOUtbaThx3"},"id":"QNdOUtbaThx3"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["path = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i40a/datasets/main/control_loop/mods/2/control_loop.csv'"],"metadata":{"id":"2pIH5QmGnZyT"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"2pIH5QmGnZyT"},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# load csv file\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MzWCW5wpyEQD"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"id":"MzWCW5wpyEQD"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Explore the dataset\n","\n","First, understand the data and variables from the [dataset repository](https://github.com/i40a/datasets/blob/main/control_loop/info.md).\n","\n","Then, use the numerical and visualization libraries to get insights from the data.\n","\n","### Possible operations\n","* Number and name of the control loops\n","* Number and name of variables\n","* Plot all variables for one loop (FIC32, for example)"],"metadata":{"id":"_Q6btqbolSzW"},"id":"_Q6btqbolSzW"},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"363wuOXDlWoQ"},"id":"363wuOXDlWoQ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"xOUuBNU0nF4J"},"id":"xOUuBNU0nF4J","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"uKqdNZStgB8S"},"id":"uKqdNZStgB8S","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"gIMKRYC-nMzR"},"id":"gIMKRYC-nMzR","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Algorithms"],"metadata":{"id":"wLsnjJspolrY"},"id":"wLsnjJspolrY"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Faulty sensor\n","\n","Detects faulty sensor by noise level.
